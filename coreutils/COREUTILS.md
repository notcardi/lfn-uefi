# Compiling core utilities
Core utilities are an essential part of a system, as they are what brings everything together. Something as simple as the 'ls' command is handled by the core utilities and the shell. So, there is definitely a need for this. To stay true, we will also use the GNU Coreutils. Note that there are also other alternatives like Busybox, Ubase and Sbase, and many others. You will need to read the documentation for those, though.

Cloning the git repository is pretty simple:\
``# git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/coreutils.git``
