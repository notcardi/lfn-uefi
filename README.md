# lfn-uefi
A recreation of Maple Circuit's LFN (Linux from Nothing) for UEFI. I would highly reccomend checking out his channel/series first (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkoRSCZZILDO-YU9Ct-KeVEW71hzeZJu7&si=0dt8Y62LUN4aYBQ_).

# Basics of a linux system.
A linux system (in it's very basics) requires not too much to use:
- A root device to use it
- An init system that the kernel passes off
- A shell and core utilities
Now, your linux system probably has way more things than that, but if we can get to that very basic step there, we can be set to keep expanding upon it until it does look like your system.
